  I think everything posted was actually very logical. But, what about this?
  suppose you wrote a catchier post title? I mean, I don't want to tell you how
  to run your website, however what if you added a post title to possibly get
  folk's attention? I mean %BLOG_TITLE% is a little boring. You ought to peek at
  Yahoo's home page and watch how they write post headlines to grab viewers
  interested. You might try adding a video or a related pic or two to grab
  readers interested about what you've written. In my opinion, it would make
  your posts a little livelier.
